#1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client is Artemis Financial, and they required assistance in ensuring secure communications and identifying the weaknesses in their system. Assuring the safety of their financial software and locating any potential flaws that bad actors might exploit were the main priorities.
#2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I thoroughly examined the software's security flaws, looking for possible gaps with the help of both automatic tools and manual inspection. Secure coding is essential since it guards against financial losses, illegal access, and data breaches. It also protects the company's reputation and clientele, which improves its general health.
#3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Finding small security vulnerabilities that might not be seen at first look was the most difficult aspect of the vulnerability assessment process. But it was also the most beneficial because it helped me better understand possible attack routes and go further into the architecture of the software.
#4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
By using secure coding standards, such as input validation, authentication procedures, and encryption techniques, I was able to add more layers of protection. In the future, I would thoroughly evaluate vulnerabilities using a combination of manual code reviews and static and dynamic analysis techniques. Furthermore, I would rank mitigation strategies according on how well they handle hazards that have been identified.
#5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To make sure the code and software application were secure and functional, I carried out extensive testing, including security tests. After refactoring the code, I performed further security testing to check if I introduced any new vulnerabilities.
#6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized various resources and tools, including OWASP guidelines and Maven dependency check plug-in. Furthermore, it was advantageous to adhere to secure coding guidelines like secure by default, least privilege, and the concept of least surprise, as these would come in handy for upcoming projects or assignments.
#7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I can present the finished report on secure software practices or vulnerability assessment from this project. These artifacts show my grasp of secure coding methods and principles as well as my ability to recognize and resolve security risks.
